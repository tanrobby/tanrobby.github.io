      possible extension), so please prepare and plan early and carefully.
      <br>

      <h4><b>Part 1: 2D Convolution</b></h4>
      <ol>
      <li>
	Write a program for the image 2D
	convolution. It should be able to process any grayscale input image, and
	operate using the following kernels:
	<ul>
	<li>Sobel kernel,
	<li>Gaussian kernel, 
	<li>The 5 Haar-like masks (note, for this part, the user should be able to set the scale of the masks)
	</ul>
      <li> Show the results of the convolution with each of the
      kernels above on this image: <a href="img\einstein.png" target="_blank">URL</a>.
      <li> Write your conclusions on the outputs of each of the
      kernels, and explain how the size of the kernel influences the outputs.
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 2: SIFT Features and Descriptors</b></h4>
      <ol>
	<li> Download the images from
	here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cnyst3qnjkck5mr/assg1.zip?dl=0"
	target="_blank">link</a>.
	 Extract  SIFT keypoints from im01.jpg using any publicly
	available SIFT code. Show the keypoints on the images, like
	shown below (similar but not necessarily the same):
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/01.jpg" alt="input" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <br>	  
      </ol>
      
	  
      <h4><b>Part 3: Homography</b></h4>
	<b> For this part, you must write your own code for computing
	the homography matrix and transforming an image.</b>
      <ol>
	<li>
	Download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xcnv21v5ww1vefj/h1.jpg?dl=0"
	 target="_blank">h1.jpg</a>
	and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2twxi19rv9fsg29/h2.jpg?dl=0"
	       target="_blank">h2.jpg</a>. Write a code to show a GUI
	 (graphical user interface) where the user can click 4 points on an  image.
	   Let the user to choose 4 points on h1.jpg and 4 points
	  on h2.jpg
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/08.jpg" alt="input" height="300" />
	  <img src="img/09.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 	  
	  <br>
	<li> Compute the homography matrix from h1.jpg to h2.jpg, and show
	  the homography matrix.
	  Use the homography matrix to tranform h1.jpg to h2.jpg, and show
	the result:
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/10.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 
	  <br>
	<li> Compute the homography matrix from h2.jpg to h1.jpg, and show
	  the homography matrix.
	<li> Use the second homography matrix to tranform h2.jpg to h1.jpg, and show
	the result:
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/11.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 
	  <br>
	<li> Download the two images below: <a href="img/simpsons.jpg"
	target="_blank">simpsons.jpg</a> and <a href="img/bus.jpg"
	target="_blank">bus.jpg</a>. Ask the user to select the points
	for transforming the simpsons image
	to the advertisement area of the bus. Compute the homography,
	transform the image, and show the transformation result,
	similar to:
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/bussimpsons.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 
	  <br>
	
      </ol>
      <br>
	  
      <h4><b>Part 4: Manual Homography + Sticthing</b></h4>
      <ol>
	<li> Load im01.jpg and im02.jpg.  Let the user to choose 4 points on im01.jpg and 4 points
	  on im02.jpg
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/12.jpg" alt="input" height="300" />
	  <img src="img/13.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 	  
	  <br>
	<li> Compute the homograhy matrix, and stitch the images together using the computed homography
	  matrix and show the result:
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/14.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 	  
	  <br>
	<li> Explain why there is an effect of double edges in the overlapping regions between im01.jpg and im02.jpg
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4><b>Part 5: Homography + RANSAC</b></h4>
      <ol>
	<li> Load im01.jpg and im02.jpg. Based on SIFT, find matches
	between the two images.  Show all the matches, similar to:
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/15.jpg" alt="input" height="250" /> 	  
	  <br>
	<li> Compute the best homography matrix using RANSAC, and show all the inlier matches (matches that
	support your best homography matrix):
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/16.jpg" alt="input" height="250" /> 	  
	  <br>
	  
	<li> Stitch the images together using the best homography  matrix and show the result:
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/17.jpg" alt="input" height="300" />
	  <img src="img/18.jpg" alt="input" height="300" /> 	  
	  <br>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 6: Basic Panoramic Image</b></h4>
      For this part and the next part, you can use any set of images
      (even images taken by yourself)  that support your implementation. You must include the
      images in your submission.
      <ol>
	<li> Using SIFT and RANSAC for computing the homography
	matrices, create a program to generate panoramic images given
	  ordered images. Using as many provided images as you can,
	  show the output of your panoramic image.  
	<li> The figure below is generated from 3 images and is
	  just an example. You must use as many images as you can.
	  <br>
	  <img src="img/19.jpg" alt="input" height="300" />
	  <br>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 7: Advanced Panoramic Image</b></h4>
      You will receive more scores if you include the following
	  implementation in your submission (the score depends on the
      complexity of the problems and your solutions). To be graded, you must
      provide some explanation about your implementation and results. 
      <ol>
	<li> Handling unordered images
	<li> Showing the error accumulation problem and implementing the
	  bundle adjustment for solving the problem
	<li> Warping, straigthening, gain compensation and multiband blending
	<li> Other problems that are beyond the basic panoramic image in
	Part 6.
      </ol>
      Note, for the first three problems,
      see <a href="http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf"
      target="_blank">paper 1 (Automatic Panoramic Image Stitching using Invariant Features)</a> and for the
      paralax problem
      see <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/papers/cvpr2014-stitching.pdf"
      target="_blank">paper 2 (Parallax-tolerant Image
      Stitching)</a>. <b>No consultation is provided for this part</b>.
      <br>
      <br>      
	  <h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your <b>Jupyter notebook file </b> (containing: codes, results
	and answers of the questions) via LumiNUS. Again, your
	codes must be grouped/separated based on the parts above.
	Deadlines are strict. Late submission will be deducted 2
	points (out of 10) for every 24 hours.
