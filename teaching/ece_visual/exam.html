	<h3>FINAL EXAM RULES</h3>
      </center>
      <br>


      This is an important announcement regarding the final exam. Read
      carefully: 
      
      <ol>
	<li> A mock exam is conducted on this Friday (Nov. 20) at 1pm
	  (duration: one hour). This mock
	  exam is MANDATORY. You will not be able allowed to  take the actual
	  final exam, if you fail to attend this mock exam.

	<li>
	  The mode of the exam is multiple responses. For each question, a
	  full score is given if all responses are correct.

	  <li>
The exam duration is 120 minutes. During this time, you are not
allowed to leave without the approval from the invigilator. You must
stay all the time even if you have completed your exam.

	  <li>
The exam questions will be randomized and shuffled, and thus the
questions and their order are different for each student.

	  <li>
During the exam, only mouse is allowed to use. Keyboard in any
forms (including on-screen keyboard) or any other inputs are not
allowed.

	  <li>
During the exam, your computer screen must contain only
Luminus-Quiz. No other applications are allowed. No internet (other
than Luminus-Quiz), pdf, etc to be opened/accessed.

	  <li>
During the exam, you are only allowed to bring/access maximum 2
sheets of A4 papers, where you can write anything you want. No books
or other resources are allowed to bring/access.

	  <li>
Invigilation is done through zoom. It means you must use a second
device (e.g., your mobile phone) to capture your face, hand, and
computer screen, and share it through zoom. See this link for the view
arrangement:

	  <li>
You must arrange your second device before logging in to
zoom. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to enter the session.

before the exam starts. The zoom session will open 45 minutes before
the exam starts.

	  <li>
Violations on the above rules are considered cheating and will
have very serious consequences including possible expulsion from NUS.

      FAQs:
      
      <ul>
	<li>
What happens if there is a permanent internet breakdown that cannot be
fixed during the exam?  

<br>
You must inform the invigilators immediately when the breakdown
happens (by calling the provided emergency number). You must
provide evidence that it is the telco's fault in order to be
considered for further processes.

<li>

Is there any place/room in the ECE building where students can sit
during the exam? This is because in some cases the internet access at
home is unstable. 

<br>

If you are from FoE (Zone A), you can email to the Faculty at
ug_engin_exam@nus.edu.sg for such a request. If you're not from Zone 
A, you can contact this email address or ask your respective faculty. 

<li>
  What happens if there is a temporary internet breakdown?
