      <b>Read carefully</b>: Academic integrity must be strictly followed. Copying from other's
      code or from any sources is not allowed.
      Exchanging codes is not allowed.
      Software will be used
      to detect any forms of source code plagiarism.
      The maximum score for
      completing part 1 until part 4 is 85. More scores are given
      for submission on part 5.
      You must indicate   the parts and numbers
      clearly. Your submitted code must be grouped/separated 
      into the same parts as in the instructions. In your submission, you
      must provide us with all necessary libraries.
      If you use separate files in your submission, you must zip them
      to one file. The submission must not be in separate files in
      different times (it must be submitted together).
      The deadline is a strict deadline, so
      please prepare and plan early and carefully. Late submission will be deducted 2
	points (out of 10) for every 24 hours.

      <b>Programming language: Python version 3. Submission: Jupyter
      Notebook (any other format won't be accepted).</b> In your
      Jupyter notebook file, you must compile the codes and show the
      results there in the file. If you have multiple files in your
      submission, you must zip them into one file.

      <h4><b>Part 1: Noise Removal</b></h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
	<li>Install Graphcuts for Python by installing from <a href="https://github.com/Borda/pyGCO" 
	    target="_blank">here</a>. Ensure that your python
	    can call "import pygco" (in some setting pygco.py,
	    originally in the gco folder, should be able to be called
	  from your code). On the website, the execution of "make
	    download" might give you an error message, but you don't
	    need to worry as the graphcut code is already provided in
	    the "gco_source" folder.
	  <br>
	  <strong>Note that</strong>: There is an alternative graphcut wrapper called
	  PyMaxflow [<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyMaxflow/"
	  target="_blank">pypi</a>
	  | <a href="http://pmneila.github.io/PyMaxflow/"
	  target="_blank">website</a>]. However, it works only when
	  the smoothness 
	  constraint is the same for all pixels. This PyMaxflow works
	  fine for Parts 1 and 2, yet it doesn't provide optimal
	  solutions for Parts 3 and 4, namely when \lambda is
	  dependent on x.
	  
	<li>Write a python program to clean up the noise of the image
	  in Figure 1, by employing an MRF  and  the binary graphcuts. See the
	  pseudocode in C <a href="pseudocode.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<li> Change the value of the weighting factor (lambda) of the prior
	term, and show some different results (due to different values
	of lambda). You must
	state the values of your lambda along with the corresponding
	  results.
	<li> Show your best result and provide some
	  discussion if necessary (particularly if the results are not
	  as good as expected).

      <h4><b>Part 2: Depth from Rectified Stereo Images</b></h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
	<li> Write a program to estimate a depth map from the pair of
	  rectified images in Figure 2 using an MRF and multiple label graphcuts.
	<li> Show your best result and provide some
	  discussion if necessary (particularly if the results are not
	  as good as expected).

      <h4><b>Part 3: Depth from Stereo:</b></h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
      
	<li> Write a program to estimate a depth map from a pair of
	  calibrated images in Figure 4 using an MRF and graphcuts. The camera
	  matrices are available <a href="cameras.txt"
				    target="_blank">here</a>. Note that, for finding the epipolar
	  lines using the provided camera matrices, you might want to use
	  the following equation: 
	  <img src="eq.png" alt="input" width="504" />
	  <br>

	  <br>
	  <img src="test00.jpg" alt="input" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <img src="test09.jpg" alt="output" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <center>
	    <b>Figure 4: A pair of non-rectified images</b>
	  </center>
	<li>Note that,
	     the images, camera matrices, and last equation are
	      borrowed from  the paper ("Consistent Depth Maps Recovery
	      from a Video Sequence", TPAMI'09).
	      In this paper, the mathematical
	      notations are different from what I taught in
	      class. However, if you use the notations consistently
	      following the paper, then you should be fine.
	  <li> Show your best result, and provide some
	  discussion if necessary (particularly if the results are not
	  as good as expected).
      </ol>

      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 4: Depth from Video -- Basic:</b></h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
     <li> Write a program to estimate depth map from video
     using the method described in this paper: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhuw13pnizmog3u/2009_PAMI_depth_map.pdf?dl=0"
						  target="_blank">Depth
     Map from Video Sequence</a>. 
     <li>  Unlike the original steps in the paper, in this part of the
	  assignment, you
	  only need to 
	  implement the initialization and bundle optimization steps.

      <li> For the input, use a video you can download
      from: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rctkhpw6jh1p22o/Road.zip?dl=0"
	       target="_blank">here</a> (300MB).
      <li> The camera parameters of the video are provided in the
	zipped file in the download. 
      <li> The minimum number of frames to process is 5
      frames. However, the grading will include the quality of your
	depth map, and the more frames you process, the higher the
      quality of your depth will be.
	<li> Show some of your best results. Provide some
	  discussion if necessary (particularly if the results are not
	  as good as expected). Also mention how many frames you use
	  to generate the best results.
	<li> An example of the expected result:
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <img src="test0100.jpg" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <img src="depth0100.png" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <br>
	  
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Part 5: Depth from Video -- Advanced:</b></h4>
      <br>
      You will receive more scores if you include the following
	  implementation in your submission. To be graded, you must
      provide some explanation on your implementation and results. You
	  can choose any of the options below: 
      <ol>
	<li> Full implementation of the paper  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhuw13pnizmog3u/2009_PAMI_depth_map.pdf?dl=0"
	       target="_blank">Depth Map from Video Sequence</a> (all
	  steps) on a full set of the provided video clip.
	<li> Find the drawbacks of the paper, and implement your
	solutions. For this, you must explain the
	drawbacks, show the evidence of the drawbacks, discuss how
	your solutions can solve
	the drawback, and show
	the improved results (in comparison to the original results).
      </ol>
      You  must mention and briefly discuss what you
      have done for part 5, and
      show the results that represent what you have done.
      <b>No consultation is provided for this part</b>.

      <h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your <b>Jupyter notebook file </b> (containing: codes, results
	and answers of the questions) via LumiNUS. Again, your
	codes must be grouped/separated based on the parts above.
	Deadlines are strict. Late submission will be deducted 2
	points (out of 10) for every 24 hours.
