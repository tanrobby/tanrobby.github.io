	<h2> Exercise 10: Greedy Algorithms</h2>

	<li> Write code in python for the activity selection problem as discussed in
	class and explained in the textbook.
	<li> Considering the activity selection problem, suppose that
	  instead of always selecting the first activity to finish, we
	  instead select the last activity to start that is compatible
	  with all previously selected activities. Describe how this
	  approach is a greedy algorithm, and prove that it yields an
	  optimal solution.
	<li>
	  Suppose that we have a set of activities to schedule among a
	  large number of lecture halls, where any activity can take
	  place in any lecture hall. We wish to schedule all the
	  activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an
	  efficient greedy algorithm to determine which activity
	  should use which lecture hall.
	<li> Consider this problem: Given weights and values of n
	items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the
	maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two
	integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent
	values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also
	given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find
	out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the
	weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You
	cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or don’t
	  pick it (0-1 property).
	  <br>	  
	  For this problem, give a dynamic-programming solution that
	  runs in O(nW)O(nW) time, where n is the number of items and
	  W is the maximum weight of  items that the thief can put in
	  his knapsack.
	<li> Write code in python to implement  the Huffman codes as discussed in
	class and explained in the textbook.
	<li>
What is an optimal Huffman code for the following set of frequencies, based on
the first 8 Fibonacci numbers?
< a:1  b:1   c:2  d:3  e:5  f:8  g:13  h:21 >
Can you generalize your answer to find the optimal code when the
frequencies are the first nn Fibonacci numbers? 
        <li>
Every positive fraction can be represented as sum of unique unit fractions. A fraction is unit fraction if numerator is 1 and denominator is a positive integer, for example 1/3 is a unit fraction. Such a representation is called Egyptian Fraction as it was used by ancient Egyptians.

Following are few examples:
<br>
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 2/3 is 1/2 + 1/6
<br>
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
<br>
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156
<br>
We can generate Egyptian Fractions using Greedy Algorithm. For a given
number of the form ‘nr/dr’ where dr > nr, first find the greatest
possible unit fraction, then recur for the remaining part. For
example, consider 6/14, we first find ceiling of 14/6, i.e., 3. So the
first unit fraction becomes 1/3, then recur for (6/14 – 1/3) i.e.,
4/42.
<br>
Write code in python to implement the Egyption fraction representation.
