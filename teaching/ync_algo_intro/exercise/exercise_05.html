      <ol>
	<li> Randomized QuickSort:
	  <ol type="a">
	  <li>Write code  in  python for quicksort
	described in the textbook. Modify the code, so that you can
	    see every split arrays, and every merged arrays.
	  <li> Based on your quicksort code, write code for 
	    randomized quicksort.
	  <li> Modify your randomized quicksort code, so that you can
	  output the total number of the recursive function being
	    executed.
	  <li> Using exactly the same input, run your randomized
	    quicksort for 100 times. For each run, show the total
	    number of the recursive function being executed, and also
	    show the average total number.
	  </ol>
	<li> Randomized Selection:
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li> Write code in python for randomized selection.
	    <li> Modify your code, so that you can
	      output the total number of the recursive function being
	      executed.
	    <li> Using exactly the same input, run your code for 100 times. For each run, show the total
	      number of the recursive function being executed, and also
	      show the average total number.
	  </ol>
	<li> One of the common techniques of randomized algorithms is
	to shuffle or permute the input array. Random shuffling or
	permutation can be done in two ways: permute-by-sorting (page 125) and
	randomize-in-place (page 126), where the latter is better than
	  the former. Regarding this, answer the following questions:
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li> Write code in python to implemet the two permutation
	      methods.
	    <li> Discuss why randomize-in-place is better than
	      permute-by-sorting.
	    <li> If we change line 3 of randomize-in-place with this
	      algorithm: swap A[i] with A[Random(1,n)], what happens?
	      Does this code produce a uniform random permutation?
	      Provide the justification for your answer.
	  </ol>
	  <li> Use indicator random variables to compute the expected
	    value of the sum of n dice.
	  <li>The hat of n people are collected and then returned to
	  the people in a random order. What is the expected number of
	  people receiving back his own hat?
