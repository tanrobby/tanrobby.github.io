	<h2> Exercise 1: Python Programming and Basic
	  Concepts of Runtime Analysis</h2>
	</center>
      <hr>
  
      <h3>Exercise 1.1: Search and Swap Functions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> Write a function to swap an element with another element
	  in the same list based on their index.
	<li> Write a function to search an integer from an array (or list) of
	  integers.
	<li> Write a function to search a character from a list of
	  characters.
	<li> Write a function that accepts a list of integers and a
	number, and outputs the division of the list by the number.

      </ol>
      
      <h3>Exercise 1.2: Argument Passing in Python</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> If we want to pass a variable to a function
	without expecting the variable to change its value after
	executing the function (i.e., passing by value), how can we do
	it? Provide an example.
	<li> If we want to pass a variable to a function
	and expect some change of the value of the variable (i.e., passing by reference), how can we do
	it? Provide an example.
	<li> In Python, argument passing for functions is based on
	"passing by object reference". What does it mean by this?
	Discuss how its work and provide an example.
      </ol>


      <h3>Exercise 1.3: For Loops,  While Loops, Break and Continue</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> If you use for loops in Exercise 1.1., change them to
	  while loops.
	<li> Find an example of a case that uses 'break', and write
	  its python code.
	<li> Find an example of a case that uses 'continue', and write
	  its python code.
      </ol>

      <h3>Exercise 1.4: Selection Sort</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> Write a python code for  Selection Sort based on its pseudocode.
	<li> Change the code, so that the sorting is done
	in a descending order.
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Exercise 1.5: Loop Runtime Analysis</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> Given a 1D array, if we use a linear search algorithm,
	what is the runtime? Prove your answer by first writing the
	pseudocode, and then showing the runtime computation.
	<li> The same question as number 1 above but for a 2D array.
	<li> The same question as number 1 above but for a 3D array.
      </ol>

      <h3>Exercise 1.6: Growth of Functions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> 
      </ol>
