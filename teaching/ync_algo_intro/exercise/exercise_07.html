	<h2> Exercise 7: Elementary Data Structures</h2>

      <hr>
      <h3>Part 1: (Compulsory)</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> Write code in Python for implementing the queue data
	structures and  its operations (enqueuing and dequeuing) using Python.
	<li> Write code in C/C++ to implement a singly linked list, where
	each node contains an object with the following attributes:
	(1) student ID, (2) student name, (3) student's date of
	  birth. In your code, implement insert and search operations.
	<li>Write code in Python to implement a singly linked list, where
	each node contains an object with the following attributes:
	(1) student ID, (2) student name, (3) student's date of
	  birth.
	<li> For your Python code, write the following operations:
	insert, search, and delete. The search should be able to
	search based on: student's ID, name, date of birth, and year
	of birth.
      </ol>
      <h3>Part 2:</h3>
      <ol>
	<li> Write code in Python to implement the open hash table. In the
	code implement the following operations: insert, search,
	delete for n data samples, where n is the number of keys. Each
	  of the keys has a fixed length and is randomly generated.
	<li> Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze
	  the running time of the queue operations.
	<li> Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a
	direct-address table T of length m. Describe a procedure that
	finds the maximum element of S . What is the worst-case
	  performance of your procedure?
	<li> Demonstrate what happens when we insert the keys 5, 28,
	19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table with collisions
	resolved by chaining. Let the table have 9 slots, and let the
	  hash function be h(k)=  k mod 9.
	<li> Consider inserting the keys 10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17,
	88, 59 into a hash table of length m = 11 using open
	addressing (closed hash table) with the auxiliary hash
	function h'(k) = k. Illustrate the result of inserting these keys using linear probing.
