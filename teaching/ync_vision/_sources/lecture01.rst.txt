      Looking at the image, we can immediately understand the scene
      intuitively and effortlessly. @Image is taken from the Internet.

The goal of computer vision is to make computers work like human visual perception, namely, to recognize the world's visual information.
Given a natural image :numref:`fig1`, in a fraction of a second we can immediately recognize the contents and are inevitably immediately conscious about what is happening in the image.
The question is how we can do it. 
It seems to us the task of understanding visual information is
intuitive and effortless, similar to walking, speaking, hearing, etc.
Hence, it begs some questions. Why is it difficult? How
can we create computer algorithms to do it? Computer vision attempts
to answer these questions.


There are a few closely related fields in computer science that can
help us understand computer vision better: computer graphics, image
processing, and artificial intelligence. The main task of computer
graphics is to generate images from mathematical models. It renders
synthetic images that may not be distinguishable from real
images. Computer vision is the exact opposite of computer graphics. It
attempts to extract information (including the mathematical models)
from a real image or images. Another related field is image
processing. The input of image processing is an image and the output
is also an image, which is normally better in terms of quality
compared to the input image. An example of image processing is
denoising or noise removal. Image processing is actually part of
computer vision, which is called low-level vision. Image processing or
low-level vision is helpful to complete the main goal of computer
vision, since the information in the input image can be made clearer
(less noisy or less degraded).
