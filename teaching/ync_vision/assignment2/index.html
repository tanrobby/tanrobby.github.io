      <b>Read carefully</b>: Academic integrity must be stricly followed. Copying-and-pasting from other's
      code or froms any sources is not allowed. Software will be used
      to detect any form of source code plagiarism. You must write
      your code in ipython notebook (or ipython jupiter) and write a
      report in a pdf format as instructed below. In the report, you
      must indicate the parts and numbers
      clearly. Your submitted code must be grouped/separated 
      into the same parts as in the instructions. In your submission, you
      must provide us with all necessary libraries. The maximum score for
      completing part 1 until part 7 is 90 (out of 100). More scores are given
      for submission on part 8. The deadlines are strict deadlines
      (point reduction for late submission), so please prepare and plan early and carefully.

      <h4><b>Part 1: Image Convolution</b></h4>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Write  a program in Python for image 2D convolution, and apply
	    to this image:
	    <br>
	    <img src="img/einstein.png" alt="input" height="250" />
	    <br>	  	  	  	
	  <li> Use the Sobel kernel
	    [<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/sobel.htm"

	   and show the results for sigma = 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0.
	  <li> Downscale the image into 24x24 pixels, and use the three types of Haar-like mask, where the sizes of the
	  masks are 5 times of the default sizes. Enlarge the results
	  to 250x250 pixels, and show them.
	</ol>

	matrices, create a program to generate panoramic images given
	  ordered images
	<li> In your report, using as many provided images as you can,
	  show the output of your panoramic image.  Ideally, you
	  should show the panoramic image of a 
	  360-degree set of images.
	<li> The figure below is generated from 3 images and is
	  just an example. You must use as many images as you can.

      provide some explanation about your implementation and results
      in your report. 
      <ol>
	<li> Handling unordered images.
	<li> Showing the error accumulation problem and implementing the
	  bundle adjustment for solving the problem.
	<li> Warping, straigthening, gain compensation and multiband blending.
	<li> Existing problems with the current state of the art
	  methods, and the solutions that you have implemented.
	<li> Find other drawbacks of the one instructed above, and
	solve them, so that you can have other additional features in
	your stitching program. For this, in your report, you must
	explain/give evidence of the drawbacks, discuss the solution,
	and show results.
      </ol>
