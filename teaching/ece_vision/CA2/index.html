      <b>Read carefully</b>: Academic integrity must be stricly followed. Copying-and-pasting from other's
      code or froms any sources is not allowed. Software will be used
      to detect any form of source code plagiarism. You must write
      your code in ipython notebook (or jupiter notebook), and indicate
      the number of the questions/instructions clearly. <b>You must
      include your jupyter notebook file and the input images in your
      submission. You must show your code and 
      your results on the submitted jupyter notebook </b>.
      </p>

      <h4>Part I: Noise Removal</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Install Graphcuts for Python by executing: <strong>pip install
	    PyMaxflow</strong> (or install manually
	    from <a href="https://github.com/pmneila/PyMaxflow" 
	    target="_blank">here</a>). Read   
	  the online documents [<a href="http://pmneila.github.io/PyMaxflow/" target="_blank">website</a>] to know how to set the edges
	  of  the graph. 
	<li>Write a python program to clean up the noise of the image
	  in Figure 1, by employing an MRF  and  the binary graphcuts. See the
	  pseudocode in C <a href="pseudocode.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<li> Change the value of the weighting factor (lambda) of the prior
	term, and show some different results (due to different values
	of lambda) in your report. You must
	state the values of your lambda along with the corresponding
	  results.
	<li> Show your results for different lambda values, and provide some
	  discussion.
	  <li> Show the best result.

	  <img src="bayes_out.jpg" alt="output" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <br>
	    <br>
	  <b>Figure 1. Left: Input noisy image. Right: Expected
	    output.</b>
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <h4>Part II: Color Segmentation</h4>
      <ol>
	<li> First, implement K-mean clustering to initialize the
	segmentation, and to obtain K-center colors. The user should
	be able to enter the value of K (the number of the segmented
	colors). 
 
	  Then, build MRFs with multilabels and optimize by using the multilabel
	  graphcuts (using PyMaxFlow). In the multilabel graphcuts, you should define
	  the smoothness cost when two labels are the same (e.g. cost
	  = 0) and when they are different (e.g. cost = 1). The data
	  cost can be defined as the distance between the pixel color
	  to each of the K-center colors. 
     <li> Show the segmentation results of a given images with
       different settings of K.
       <li> Discuss the
	 drawbacks of the algorithm. How can you
       improve the algorithm?
       <li> Show the best segmentation results of at least 3 different
       input images, similar to:
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <img src="castle.jpg" alt="input" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <img src="castle_result.jpg" alt="output" width="504" height="328" /> 
	  <br>
	    <br>
	  <b>Figure 1. Left: Input image. Right: Possible  output.</b>
      </ol>

      <br>
      
	<h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your jupyter notebook via Luminus by the deadline. <b>Late
	submission will be deducted 2 points (out of 10) for every 24
	hours.</b> Please contact the GA (Jeremy, Xin Yang) is you
	have any questions regarding this assignment.
