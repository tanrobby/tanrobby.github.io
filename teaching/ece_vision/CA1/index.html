      <b>Read carefully</b>: Academic integrity must be stricly followed. Copying-and-pasting from other's
      code or froms any sources is not allowed. Software will be used
      to detect any form of source code plagiarism. You must write
      your code in ipython notebook (or jupiter notebook), and indicate
      the number of the questions/instructions clearly. <b>You must
      include your code and  show
      your results on the submitted jupyter notebook </b>.

      <h4>Part I: Basic</h4>
      In this part, given a texture sample, you need to generate a larger
	texture image with similar visual appearance to the sample
	using to the synthesis algorithms we discussed in class. 

      <ol>
	<li>First, create a large empty image (E) and copy the
      texture sample (T) to
      its upper left corner as a starting point for your synthesis
      program. 
     <li> Next, iteratively replace the blank pixels (empty regions)
      in E with the pixels from T. At each 
      iteration, a blank pixel 
      with the largest number of ‘known’ neighboring pixels is
      replaced. The pixel selected from texture sample has the closest
      neighborhood to the blank pixel among all sample pixels. This
      similarity of neighborhood is evaluated by a Gaussian weighted
       SSD.
     <li> Show at least 3 different results, similar to:
       <br>
       <img src="im1.jpg" width="500">
       <li> Discuss your findings through the experiment,
       particularly: 
       how the neighborhood size affects the synthesis results and
       speed? What kind of data works best/worst? How the implemented
       algorithm can be improved in terms of result quality and
       efficiency.
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h4>Part II: PatchMatch</h4>
      In this part, you will implement a basic version of
	PatchMatch (which can be used to speed-up texture synthesis)
      to find similar patches between two images.
      PatchMatch can be read from this paper: 
Barnes, Connelly, et al. "PatchMatch: A randomized correspondence algorithm for structural image
 editing" TOG, 2009:
      [<a href="https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Barnes_2009_PAR/"
	  target="_blank">PDF</a>]
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
	You are required to find for each
      patch in image A, a close match in image B. This close match is
      not exact but approximated by the PatchMatch algorithm. Patches
      are defined around each pixel in image A and B. 
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li> For every patch in image A, assign corresponding patch in image
      B arbitrarily (a random guess), and store the offsets (u, v) and
      patch distance D in a 3-channel array. You may use SSD of the
	  color difference to compute D.
      Then, propagate the offsets in scan order from left to right, top to
      bottom in odd iteration, and from right to left, bottom to top
      in even iteration. Replace a patch’s offset with its neighbor’s
      if the new offset gives smaller D. For our task, it should
      suffice to iterate 2 to 5 times. 
      The random search step is optional. You may refer to Sec.3.3.2
      in the PatchMatch paper
	  to implement this step if you want to improve the results.
	  
	<li>Visualize the x and y coordinates of the patch correspondence field
      (plot them as images). Use the pixel color given by (x, y) in
      image B to reconstruct image A.
     <li> Show at least 3 different results, similar to:
       <br>
       <img src="im2.jpg" width="1000">
       <li> Discuss your findings through the experiment,
       particularly: 
       how the neighborhood size affects the synthesis results and
       speed? What kind of data works best/worst? 
      </ol>

	<h4><b>Submission:</b></h4>
      <p>
	Submit your jupyter notebook via Luminus by the deadline. <b>Late
	submission will be deducted 2 points (out of 10) for every 24
	hours.</b> Please contact the GA (Jeremy, Xin Yang) is you
	have any questions regarding this assignment.
