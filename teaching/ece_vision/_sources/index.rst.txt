EE4221: Computer Vision (Part 2)
===================================

Description
------------
Images and videos are everywhere.
Using your mobile phone, it is  easy to snap pictures or record videos.
These images/videos have rich information, and are useful for various applications, from self-driving cars to surveillance systems.
However, there is a critical question that we need to answer, namely, how we can  automatically extract the rich visual information from those images/videos. This is the task of computer vision to answer this question.


The goal of computer vision is to make computers work like human visual
perception, namely, to understand and recognize the world through visual data.
For humans, seeing is intuitive and effortless, however how exactly we can do it is still a mystery.
In other words, to decipher or decode our seeing ability to computer
algorithms is not obvious and extremely challenging.


This is part 2 of EE4221. In this part, we focus on the photometric aspects of
computer vision.
