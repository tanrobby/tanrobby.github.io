      <b>Read carefully</b>:
      This is an individual assignment.
      Academic integrity must be strictly
      followed. Copying from other's code/text or from anyone or any
      source is not allowed (unless stated clearly in the
      instructions).
      Exchanging codes/text is not allowed. Software
      will be used to detect any form of source code plagiarism. Your
      submitted code must be grouped/separated into the same parts in
      the instructions. In your submission, you must provide us with
      all necessary libraries, so that we can compile your code.
      You are not allowed to use any
      toolboxes unless stated in the instructions explicitly (if you
      are not sure, you should ask). If you use 
      separate files in your submission, you must zip them to one
      file. The submission must not be in separate files in different
      times (it must be submitted together once). The deadline is strict,
      so please prepare and plan early and carefully. Late 
      submission will cause score deduction (assuming 100 is the full
      score, there will be deduction of 10 points in the first 24
      hours, 30 points in the next 24 hours, 60 points in the next 24 hours,
      and 100 points beyond this).

	<figcaption>Figure 1: Style transfer using Image-to-Image Translation</figcaption>

	<br>
	In this assignment, your tasks is to translate from one
	image to another image, as examples shown in Fig. 1.

	<h3>CA3-Part 1: PyTorch Code</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Download the data from:
	<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/"
	target="_blank">Kaggle: I’m Something of a 
	    Painter Myself</a>.

	<li>Use the data to implement an appropriate algorithm to transfer an image into
	Monet’s styles. You are allowed to use publicly available
	code. However, it must be based  on PyTorch. Moreover, you
	must cite the source properly in your code and your report.
	</ol>
      </p>
	<h3>CA3-Part 2: Report</h3>
	Write a report in PDF based on the below instructions. You
	must write down the instruction numbers and also the
	instructions themselves on your report along with your answers
	(so that we can identify your answer rather easily).
	<ol>
	  <li> Write your name and student ID.
	  <li> Draw the architecture/pipeline. If you use the publicly
	  available code, you must state it clearly and provide the
	  link of the code.
	  <li> Explain how the method works by discussing the
	    pipeline.
	  <li> Test your model using the 3 provided images (in folder
	    CA3 Part 2-4 of the provided zip file), and show the results
	    in your report. Here is the provided zip
	    file: <a href="CA3.zip" target="_blank">download</a>. 
	  <li> Test your model using the 3 provided images (in folder
	    CA3 Part 2-5 of the provided zip file), and show the results
	    in your report.
	  <li> Compare your results with the real monet paintings
	  (available in the dataset), and state any drawbacks of your
	    results.
	  <li> Provide any possible solutions for the stated drawbacks
	  or any possible improvements for your method. Provide
	  justifications for your solutions.
	</ol>    
      </p>
	<h3>CA3-Part 3: Video</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Create a video presenting your report with duration of
	    maximum 10 minutes.
	  <li> In the video, you must use powerpoint to show your
	    slides.
	  <li> In the video, you must show your face  next to your
	    powerpoint slides while you're presenting.
	  <li> The video must be in the AVI or MP4 format.
	  <li> The presentation must follow the contents of your  report.
	</ol>
	* Any recording tool is fine, but you might want to use Zoom to record your presentation.

	<figcaption>Figure 2: Semantic Segmentation</figcaption>
	<br>
	In this assignment, your task is to segment an input image
	semantically based on the classes, as examples shown
	in Fig. 2.

	<h3>CA4-Part 1: PyTorch Code</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Find from the internet or create your best
	  model/network for semantic segmentation. You are allowed to
	  use any publicly available code. However, it must be based
	  on PyTorch. Moreover,  you must cite the source properly in
	  your code and your report.
	  <li> Train your network using the The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
	  dataset. If you are using your own GPU, you need to download
	  the dataset
	  from:  <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/"
		    target="_blank">The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset website</a>.
	    <br>
	</ol>
	<h3>CA4-Part 2: Report</h3>
	Write a report in PDF based on the below instructions. You
	must write down the instruction numbers and also the
	instructions themselves on your report along with your answers
	(so that we can identify your
	answer rather easily).
	<ol>
	  <li> Write your name and student ID.
	  <li> Draw the architecture/pipeline. If you use the publicly
	  available code, you must state it clearly and provide the
	  link of the code.
	  <li> Explain how the method works by discussing the pipeline.
	  <li> Compute the mIoU of your segmentation results with
	  respect to the corresponding ground-truths.
	  <li> Test your model using the provided 3 pet images  (in
	    folder CA4 Part 2-5 of the provided zip file) in different styles, and show the results
	    in your report. Here is the provided zip
	    file: <a href="CA4.zip" target="_blank">download</a>.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	  segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Test your model using the provided 3 pet images  (in
	    folder CA4 Part 2-7 of the provided zip file)
	    that are taken in nighttime, and show the results
	    in your report.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	    segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Provide possible solutions for the nighttime
	  segmentation problem.  Provide justifications for your
	  solutions. The more details your solution is, the
	  more points you will get.
	</ol>

      <h1>Tips for GPU Resources</h1>
      Running on GPU is more efficient for training your models. If
      you do not have GPU resources, you may
      consider <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"
