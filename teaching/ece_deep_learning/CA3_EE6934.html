	<h1> CA-3: Advanced Deep Learning (EE6934)</h1>
	<h3>Deadline: April 14, 2023 at 5pm</h3> 
	<br>
	<hr>
      </center>
      <b>Read carefully</b>:
      This is an individual assignment.
      Academic integrity must be stricly
      followed. Copying from other's code/text or from anyone or any
      source is not allowed (unless stated clearly in the
      instructions).
      Exchanging codes/text is not allowed. Software
      will be used to detect any form of source code plagiarism. Your
      submitted code must be grouped/separated into the same parts in
      the instructions. In your submission, you must provide us with
      all necessary libraries, so that we can compile your code.
      You are not allowed to use any
      toolboxes unless stated in the instructions explicitly (if you
      are not sure, you should ask). If you use 
      separate files in your submission, you must zip them to one
      file. The submission must not be in separate files in different
      times (it must be submitted together once). The deadline is strict,
      so please prepare and plan early and carefully. Late 
      submission will cause score deduction (assuming 100 is the full
      score, there will be deduction of 10 points in the first 24
      hours, 30 points in the next 24 hours, 60 points in the next 24 hours,
      and 100 points beyond this).

      <h3>Part 1: Code Implementation</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Select a deep learning paper that is published in ICLR,
	  NeurIPS and CVPR from year 2020 to 2023. Note, the paper
	    must be about deep learning.
	  <li> To avoid two or more students selecting the same paper
	  and also to avoid any papers that are possibly not suitable,
	    you must inform me by email the title of the paper by <b>March 22, 2022,
	  at 5pm</b> with subject: "[EE6934]: Paper".
	  <li> With respect to the selected paper, find the publicly
	  available code on the internet or implement the paper by
	    yourself. You are allowed to use a publicly available
	  code, however you must state it clearly in the code and also
	  in your report.
	  <li> Find relevant data beyond the ones used in the paper
	  for the purpose of either training or testing.
	  <li> Experiment with the code using your own data for
	    testing.
	  <li> You must submit your code and ensure we can compile the
	  code (hence, you must include relevant libraries).
	</ol>    
      </p>
      <h3>Part 2: Report</h3>
      <p>
	Write a report in PDF using this template: [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3k0w188potnnarm/CA3_template.zip?dl=0">zip</a>].
	<ol>
	  <li> Write your report by answering the specific questions
	  available on the provided template. You must keep the
	    questions in your report.
	  <li> In your report, you are allowed to write anything beyond the
	  questions. However you must make it clear in your report,
	  and must be placed after provided the questions. See the
	  template for details.
	  <li> The maximum length of the report is 10 pages excluding
	  the references.
	</ol>
      </p>


      <h3>Part 3: Video Presentation</h3>
      
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Create a video presenting your report with duration of
	    maximum 15 minutes.
	  <li> In the video, you must use powerpoint to show your
	    slides.
	  <li> In the video, you must show your face  next to your
	    powerpoint slides while you're presenting.
	  <li> The video must be in the AVI or MP4 format.
	  <li> The presentation must contain the following information
	  taken from your report:
	    <ul>
	      <li> Title of the selected paper
	      <li> Summary
	      <li> Experiments and Analysis
	      <li> Strengths
	      <li> Weaknesses
	      <li> Possible Improvement
	    </ul>
	</ol>
	* Any recording tool is fine, but you might want to use Zoom to record your presentation.
      </p>

      
      <br>
      <h3>Submission</h3>
	Submit your code, report and video via Canvas by
      the deadline.
