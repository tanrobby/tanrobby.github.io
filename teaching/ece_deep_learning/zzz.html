      </center>
      <b>Read carefully</b>:
      This is an individual assignment.
      Academic integrity must be strictly
      followed. Copying from other's code/text or from anyone or any
      source is not allowed (unless stated clearly in the
      instructions).
      Exchanging codes/text is not allowed. Software
      will be used to detect any form of source code plagiarism. Your
      submitted code must be grouped/separated into the same parts in
      the instructions. In your submission, you must provide us with
      all necessary libraries, so that we can compile your code.
      You are not allowed to use any
      toolboxes unless stated in the instructions explicitly (if you
      are not sure, you should ask). If you use 
      separate files in your submission, you must zip them to one
      file. The submission must not be in separate files in different
      times (it must be submitted together once). The deadline is strict,
      so please prepare and plan early and carefully. Late 
      submission will cause score deduction (assuming 100 is the full
      score, there will be deduction of 10 points in the first 24
      hours, 30 points in the next 24 hours, 60 points in the next 24 hours,
      and 100 points beyond this).

      <h1>CA3: Style Transfer using Image-to-Image Translation</h3>
<p>

	     width="300" class="center">
	<figcaption>Figure 1: Style transfer using Image-to-Image Translation</figcaption>

	<br>
	In this assignment, your tasks is to translate from one
	image to another image, as examples shown in Fig. 1.

	<h3>CA3-Part 1: PyTorch Code</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Download the data from:
	<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/"
	target="_blank">Kaggle: I’m Something of a 
	    Painter Myself</a>.

	<li>Use the data provided in this competition to
	implement an appropriate algorithm to transfer an image into
	Monet’s styles. You are allowed to use publicly available
	code. However, it must be based
	  on PyTorch. Moreover, you must cite the source properly in
	your code and your report.
	</ol>
      </p>
	<h3>CA3-Part 2: Report</h3>
	Write a report in PDF based on the below instructions. You
	must write down the instruction numbers and also the
	instructions on your report (so that we can identify your
	answer rather easily)
	<ol>
	  <li> Write your name and student ID.
	  <li> Draw the architecture/pipeline. If you use the publicly
	  available code, you must state it clearly and provide the
	  link of the code.
	  <li> Explain how the method works by discussing the pipeline.
	  <li> Test your model using 3 images taken from the kaggle
	    dataset  that are not part of the training data, and show the results
	    in your report.
	  <li> Test your model using 3 images taken from the internet
	    that are not part of the kaggle dataset, and show the results
	    in your report.

	</ol>    
      </p>
	<h3>CA3-Part 3: Video</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Create a video presenting your report with duration of
	    maximum 10 minutes.
	  <li> In the video, you must use powerpoint to show your
	    slides.
	  <li> In the video, you must show your face  next to your
	    powerpoint slides while you're presenting.
	  <li> The video must be in the AVI or MP4 format.
	  <li> The presentation must follow the contents of your
	  report.
	</ol>
	* Any recording tool is fine, but you might want to use Zoom to record your presentation.
      </p>

      <h1>CA4: Semantic Segmentation</h3>
      <p>
	<img src="image/segmentation.jpg" alt="segmentation"
	     width="300" class="center">
	<figcaption>Figure 2: Semantic Segmentation</figcaption>
	<br>
	In this assignment, your task is to segment an input image
	semantically based on the classes, as examples shown
	in Fig. 2.

	<h3>CA4-Part 1: PyTorch Code</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Find from the internet or create your best
	  model/network for semantic segmentation. You are allowed to
	  use any publicly available code. However, it must be based
	  on PyTorch. Moreover,  you must cite the source properly in
	  your code and your report.
	  <li> Train your network using the clear day Cityscape
	  dataset. If you are using your own GPU, you need to download
	  the dataset
	  from:  <a href="https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/"
		    target="_blank">e website</a>.
	    <br>
	</ol>
	<h3>CA4-Part 2: Report</h3>
	Write a report in PDF based on the below instructions. You
	must write down the instruction numbers and also the
	instructions on your report (so that we can identify your
	answer rather easily)
	<ol>
	  <li> Write your name and student ID.
	  <li> Draw the architecture/pipeline. If you use the publicly
	  available code, you must state it clearly and provide the
	  link of the code.
	  <li> Explain how the method works by discussing the pipeline.
	  <li> Test your model using 3 clear daytime Cityscape images
	    that are not part of the training data, and show the results
	    in your report.
	  <li> Compute the mIoU of your segmentation results with
	  respect to the corresponding ground-truths.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	  segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Find on the internet 3 images taken in Singapore's
	  roads in clear daytime, and test your model using these 3
	  images. Show the segmented results of these 3 images.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	  segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Find on the internet 3 images taken in hazy or foggy
	  scenes, and test your model using these 3 
	  images. Show the segmented results of these 3 images.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	  segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Find on the internet 3 road images taken in nighttime,
	  and test your model using these 3  
	  images. Show the segmented results of these 3 images.
	  <li> For the previous instruction, if there are any wrong
	    segmentations, discuss why they are wrong.
	  <li> Provide a possible solution for the nighttime
	  segmentation problem. The more details your solution is, the
	  more points you will get.
	</ol>    
      </p>
	<h3>CA4-Part 3: Video</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Create a video presenting your report with duration of

      <h1>Tips for GPU Resources</h1>
      Running on GPU is more efficient for training your models. If
      you do not have GPU resources, you may
      consider <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"
